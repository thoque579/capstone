# GroupChat


## Application description: 

GroupChat is a group chat system that allows users from anywhere to communciate about whatever their hearts desire. What makes this chat different from other chats is that this chat does not require a username nor a password to login. Users are first logged in with a guest account that is already generated for them. IF they want to make their own username, they can. By simply just filling out an input form located on top of the group chat. This is quite a useful feature because other messaging apps like facebook messenger, whatsApp, and instagram all require a login to use and that creates a lot of friction because users would have to create an account then go to their emails to confirm their account information and then login. In my opinion, that seems quite ludicrious and time consuming, but with this application the user is not required to make an account and they start using it right away. So, there is ease, no friction, and its convenient for anyone to use. The application also has other features such as assigning a group chat name for their chat. When the user first enters the chat theree is a default chat name for the chat. But Users can change the name of the the chat like how they can change their usernames. 
But will current users will be able to see changes implemented made by other users. The answer is yes, changes made by users that are in the site will be displayed by other users in real time. So there is no waiting for updates or having to refresh the page. Thats what make this chat quite unique in that way. But what if there are too many messages posted by other users,there is a solution for that too. Each user that is on the site, is able to clear the chat history so users wouldn't have to worry about chats being too long or full of nonsense. 

This product is still in its beta form and their will be additional features added in the future.
